# The Shattered Kingdom - Crossroads

ROOT: CROSSROADS_MAIN

NODE: CROSSROADS_MAIN
MSG: You stand at a crossroads, the air humming with the energy of colliding stories. Three paths diverge in the twisted wood. To the left, a path paved with glittering, broken glass. In the center, a path that smells of ozone and overworked machinery. To the right, a path that echoes with the howls of unseen beasts.

# --- Path Intros (Placeholders) ---

NODE: PATH_OF_VANITY_INTRO
MSG: You choose the path of broken glass. The shards crunch under your feet, each one a fragment of a shattered dream. In the distance, you hear the faint sound of a waltz, and the cruel laughter of a queen.
CHOICE: "Continue to the Queen's Court." | target:VANITY_START

NODE: PATH_OF_INDUSTRY_INTRO
MSG: You take the path of industry. The air grows thick with steam and the clang of metal on metal. A sign, written in chaotic scrawl, reads: "The Hatter's Perpetual Tea & Manufacturing Co. - We're All Mad Here (And Productive!)"
CHOICE: "Enter the factory." | target:INDUSTRY_START

NODE: PATH_OF_PREDATION_INTRO
MSG: You venture down the path of predation. The trees press in close, their branches like grasping claws. You hear the snap of a twig nearby, and for a fleeting moment, you see a pair of glowing eyes and a wide, predatory grin.
CHOICE: "Follow the grin." | target:PREDATION_START
