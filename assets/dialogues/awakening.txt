# The Shattered Kingdom - Awakening

ROOT: AWAKENING_START

# --- The Awakening ---
NODE: AWAKENING_START
MSG: You awaken to the prickling of thorns against your skin. The air is heavy with the scent of cloying-sweet flowers and the sound of distant, discordant laughter. You are in a forest of twisted, dark trees, entangled in a thicket of enchanted briars. You don't remember how you got here, or even who you are.
CHOICE: "Where am I?" | target:AWAKENING_WHERE
CHOICE: "Who am I?" | target:AWAKENING_WHO
CHOICE: "Look around." | target:AWAKENING_LOOK

NODE: AWAKENING_WHERE
MSG: You try to push back the thorns, but they seem to grasp at your clothes. The forest feels... wrong. The trees groan like old men, and the shadows dance with unsettling glee. This place is a tapestry of broken stories, a kingdom shattered and pieced back together in a nightmare.
CHOICE: "Broken stories? What does that mean?" | target:AWAKENING_STORIES
CHOICE: "I need to get out of here." | target:AWAKENING_LOOK

NODE: AWAKENING_WHO
MSG: You search your mind for a name, a memory, anything. But there is only a void. You are a blank page in a book of mad scribbles. A story-less soul in a land of fractured tales.
CHOICE: "That can't be. I must be someone." | target:AWAKENING_LOOK
CHOICE: "A blank page... then I can write my own story." | target:AWAKENING_LOOK

NODE: AWAKENING_LOOK
MSG: You scan your surroundings more carefully. The briars are thick, but you see a faint path leading deeper into the woods. Nearby, a young girl in a red-hooded cloak is weeping softly.
CHOICE: "Approach the girl." | target:LITTLE_RED_ENCOUNTER
CHOICE: "Ignore the girl and take the path." | target:CROSSROADS_ENTER

NODE: AWAKENING_STORIES
MSG: Before you can ponder the meaning of "broken stories," you hear a soft weeping nearby. A young girl in a red-hooded cloak is huddled by a tree.
CHOICE: "Approach the girl." | target:LITTLE_RED_ENCOUNTER
CHOICE: "Ignore her and continue." | target:CROSSROADS_ENTER


# --- Little Red Riding Hood Encounter ---
NODE: LITTLE_RED_ENCOUNTER
SPEAKER: Little Red
MSG: You approach the girl, and she flinches, her eyes wide with fear. "Oh! You startled me," she whimpers. "I'm lost. I was on my way to my grandmother's house, but... but I saw a kitty."
CHOICE: "A kitty? What was so scary about a kitty?" | target:LITTLE_RED_KITTY
CHOICE: "I'm lost too. Maybe we can help each other." | target:LITTLE_RED_HELP
CHOICE: "Grandmother's house? Where does she live?" | target:LITTLE_RED_GRANDMOTHER

NODE: LITTLE_RED_KITTY
SPEAKER: Little Red
MSG: "It wasn't a normal kitty!" she insists. "It was all... teeth. And it smiled at me from the shadows. It said the woods were its hunting grounds now, and that the 'Big Bad Wolf' was just a bedtime story. Then it faded away, leaving only its grin behind."
CHOICE: "A grinning cat... that's... odd." | target:LITTLE_RED_HELP
CHOICE: "Sounds dangerous. We should be careful." | target:LITTLE_RED_HELP

NODE: LITTLE_RED_HELP
SPEAKER: Little Red
MSG: The girl nods, wiping her tears. "I'm Red. My grandmother lives in a cottage made of gingerbread. It's supposed to be safe there. Will you help me find it?"
CHOICE: "A gingerbread cottage? That sounds... familiar." | target:GINGERBREAD_QUEST_ACCEPT
CHOICE: "I have my own path to follow. Good luck, Red." | target:CROSSROADS_ENTER

NODE: LITTLE_RED_GRANDMOTHER
MSG: "Her house is just through the woods," Red says, pointing a trembling finger down a path you hadn't noticed before. "It's the one made of gingerbread and candy. It's the sweetest, safest place in the whole world."
CHOICE: "A gingerbread cottage? Are you sure it's safe?" | target:GINGERBREAD_QUEST_ACCEPT
CHOICE: "I can't get involved. I need to find my own way." | target:CROSSROADS_ENTER


# --- Gingerbread House Side Quest ---
NODE: GINGERBREAD_QUEST_ACCEPT
MSG: You agree to help Red find her grandmother's cottage. The path she leads you on is strange, the trees seeming to whisper as you pass. After a few minutes, you arrive at a clearing. In the center stands a house made of gingerbread, with candy canes for gutters and a frosting-dusted roof. It looks... delicious. And deeply unsettling.
CHOICE: "This is it? It looks like a trap." | target:GINGERBREAD_TRAP
CHOICE: "Let's go inside. I'm sure your grandmother is waiting." | target:GINGERBREAD_INSIDE

NODE: GINGERBREAD_TRAP
MSG: Red looks at you, confused. "A trap? But it's so lovely! Grandmother would never..." She trails off, her eyes wide as she stares at the doorway. A low, sweet voice drifts out. "Come in, my dears... I've been expecting you."
CHOICE: "Stay here, Red. I'll check it out." | target:GINGERBREAD_INSIDE
CHOICE: "Run! This is the witch's house from Hansel and Gretel!" | target:GINGERBREAD_FLEE

NODE: GINGERBREAD_INSIDE
SPEAKER: The Witch
MSG: You step inside the cottage. The air is thick and sweet. An old woman with a warty nose and a black cat on her shoulder beckons you closer. "Welcome, children," she cackles. "Just in time for dinner." The door slams shut behind you!
CHOICE: "This was a mistake." | target:GINGERBREAD_CONFRONT
CHOICE: "Where is Red's grandmother?" | target:GINGERBREAD_CONFRONT

NODE: GINGERBREAD_CONFRONT
MSG: The witch laughs. "Red's grandmother is... indisposed. But don't you worry. You'll be joining her soon!" The witch lunges, and you find yourself in a desperate struggle.
CHOICE: "Fight the witch!" | condition:strength>=10 | gold:50 | item:Magic Bean:MISC:0 | target:GINGERBREAD_VICTORY
CHOICE: "Try to reason with her." | target:GINGERBREAD_DEFEAT

NODE: GINGERBREAD_VICTORY
MSG: You manage to outsmart the witch, pushing her into her own oven. With the witch gone, you find a small, magical bean in her pocket. Red is safe, and she thanks you profusely before running off to find a "real" grandmother. You are left alone in the creepy, delicious house.
CHOICE: "Leave the cottage and return to the crossroads." | target:CROSSROADS_ENTER

NODE: GINGERBREAD_DEFEAT
MSG: The witch is too powerful. She overpowers you, and your story ends here, another forgotten ingredient in a witch's cauldron.
CHOICE: "..." | target:END_GAME

NODE: GINGERBREAD_FLEE
MSG: You and Red flee from the gingerbread house, the witch's laughter echoing behind you. You have escaped, but you have also lost the chance to gain a valuable item. You return to the crossroads, alone.
CHOICE: "Continue your journey." | target:CROSSROADS_ENTER

# --- End Game Node ---
NODE: END_GAME
MSG: Your story ends here.
CHOICE: "..." | target:END_GAME

# --- Crossroads Entry ---
NODE: CROSSROADS_ENTER
MSG: You've made your way to a crossroads. Three paths stretch before you, each shrouded in a different kind of mystery.
CHOICE: "Take the Path of Vanity." | target:PATH_OF_VANITY_INTRO
CHOICE: "Take the Path of Industry." | target:PATH_OF_INDUSTRY_INTRO
CHOICE: "Take the Path of Predation." | target:PATH_OF_PREDATION_INTRO
