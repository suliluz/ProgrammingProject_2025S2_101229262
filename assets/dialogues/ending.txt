# The Shattered Kingdom - The Ending

ROOT: ENDING_START

# --- The Final Confrontation ---
NODE: ENDING_START
MSG: You have gathered all three fragments of the Storyteller's Quill: the Glass Shard, the Cursed Spindle, and the Wolf's Tooth. As you hold them together, they begin to glow, merging into a single, beautiful, and powerful quill. A door you hadn't noticed before appears before you, its surface a swirling vortex of stories. This is the Door to Reality.
CHOICE: "Use the Quill to open the door." | target:ENDING_OPEN_DOOR
CHOICE: "Wait. I'm not ready." | target:CROSSROADS_MAIN

NODE: ENDING_OPEN_DOOR
MSG: As you touch the Quill to the door, a figure emerges from the vortex. It is a shadowy, monstrous version of yourself, a Jabberwock of the Psyche. "So," it hisses, its voice a chorus of all your doubts and fears. "You think you can just write your own happy ending? You think you can escape the stories that made you? You are nothing without them."
CHOICE: "I am more than just a collection of stories." | target:ENDING_CONFRONT_SELF
CHOICE: "You're right. I am nothing." | target:ENDING_FAIL
CHOICE: "I will not be defined by you." | target:ENDING_CONFRONT_SELF

NODE: ENDING_CONFRONT_SELF
MSG: The Jabberwock laughs. "Then prove it. Write your ending. But know this: every story requires a sacrifice." It presents you with a final, impossible choice. The Quill hums in your hand, ready to write one of three endings.
CHOICE: "Write an ending of Escape." | target:ENDING_ESCAPE
CHOICE: "Write an ending of Dominion." | target:ENDING_DOMINION
CHOICE: "Write an ending of Restoration." | target:ENDING_RESTORATION

# --- The Endings ---
NODE: ENDING_ESCAPE
MSG: You write of a world where the stories are separate, where Wonderland is Wonderland, and your own world is safe and sound. The Jabberwock shrieks as the Shattered Kingdom pulls apart, the different fairy tales returning to their own narratives. You find yourself back in your own reality, the Quill a simple, inert feather in your hand. You are free, but you will forever be haunted by the echoes of the stories you left behind.
CHOICE: "The End." | target:END_GAME

NODE: ENDING_DOMINION
MSG: You write an ending where you are the master of the Shattered Kingdom. The Jabberwock bows before you, becoming your monstrous servant. The characters of the realm, from the Queen of Hearts to the Mad Hatter, become your loyal subjects. You have a new story, one of power and control. But you are also trapped, a ruler in a kingdom of madness.
CHOICE: "The End." | target:END_GAME

NODE: ENDING_RESTORATION
MSG: You write of a world where the stories are not just separate, but healed. Cinderella finds her prince, the Mad Hatter finds his sanity, and the Queen of Hearts finds a measure of peace. The Shattered Kingdom becomes a new, vibrant world of happy endings. But in writing their happiness, you have used up your own story. You fade away, becoming a silent, unseen guardian of the realm you created. A forgotten author.
CHOICE: "The End." | target:END_GAME

NODE: ENDING_FAIL
MSG: You falter. The Jabberwock was right. You are nothing. The Quill clatters to the ground, and the Jabberwock consumes you. You become another forgotten story, another whisper in the madness of the Shattered Kingdom.
